# Sorting Algorithm Project 

This repository contains a Java implementation of **sorting algorithms** to demonstrate efficient ways to organize data. The project is designed for educational purposes to understand the behavior of different sorting techniques, their complexities, and their performance in various scenarios.

## Features 

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms** implemented (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.).
- **Customizable Input**: Works with different types of data arrays.
- **Performance Comparison**: Measure and compare the runtime of each algorithm.

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites 

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.
- Any Java-compatible IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code) or command line.

### Setup and Installation 

1. **Clone the repository:** 

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SortingAlgorithmProject.git
   cd SortingAlgorithmProject
   ```

2. **Compile the Java code**: 

   ```
   javac sortingAlg.java
   ```

3. **Run the program**: 

   ```
   java sortingAlg
   ```

## Usage 

- Modify the array within the code or implement a user input system to sort custom data.
- The sorting algorithms available in the program can be tested individually by calling the relevant methods.

## Example Output 
 
```
Original Array: [5, 3, 8, 6, 2]
Sorted Array (using Bubble Sort): [2, 3, 5, 6, 8]
```

## Project Structure 
 
```
sortingAlg.java  # Main file containing sorting algorithms
```

## Algorithms Implemented 

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
- **Insertion Sort**: Efficient for small data sets and partially sorted arrays.
- **Selection Sort**: Reduces the number of swaps but still not very efficient.
- **Quick Sort**: Faster on average but with a worst-case scenario of O(nÂ²).
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array and merges it back in sorted order, with O(n log n) complexity.
